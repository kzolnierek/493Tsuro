notes

I'm not really sure how we want to go about doing this because there isnt a real grid- I was kind of thinking we could just increment or decrement the margins by a standard amount of pixels, but then we would have to remember where the piece passed in was previously. Also I looked into different more complicated html/bootstrap grids and couldnt get any to work as effectively as just writing out all of the squares. If you do though, definitely change it!

Also the style of the files is quite sloppy so feel free to clean it up if it is bugging you.

to do
-figure out structures to use
-make cards and board
-allow screen resize
--we need to prevent people being added after the first card has been dealt or else the tile array will be messed up---or find another way to do this
